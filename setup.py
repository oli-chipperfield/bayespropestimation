Simple class and methods for the Bayesian estimation and comparison of proportions.  i.e. a simple Bayesian AB test of proportions.  

- A user can input the results from two samples, A and B, and get estimates of the posterior density and their difference.  

- Estimation is by simple simulation from the conjugate posterior distributions.  

- Provides summary statistics and visualisations for the estimated parameters.

- The prior distribution, sample count, random seed, credible intervals and parameter names can all be customised.
